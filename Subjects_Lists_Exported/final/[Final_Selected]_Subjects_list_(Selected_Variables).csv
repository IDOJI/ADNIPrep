Diagnosed with A-MCI by Sutter Neurologist in Dec 2016 -failed Aricept 5mg PO QHS taken over 10 days due to worsening chronic diarrhea. Has never tried Exelon patch. No history of stroke or head trauma.

Suspected conversion from A-MCI in 2017 to now with  Mild Dementia 2/2 ""mixed"" etiology. Although he doesn't have formed visual hallucinations nor fluctuations endorsed, he does have some atypical parkinsonism on neurological examination. Atypical parkinsonism could be resulted from vascular parkinsonism and overlay of spinal stenosis. However, Progressive supranuclear palsy could be early in the differential (eye movement reduced, axial rigidity). Lewy Body Variant of AD is a possibility as well. Etiology of FTD due to some of his behavior and executive impairment is also within differential.
