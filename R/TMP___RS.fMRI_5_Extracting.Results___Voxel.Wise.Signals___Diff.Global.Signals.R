# In R, you can perform global signal regression (GSR) on your resting-state fMRI data using the following steps:
#
#   Load your fMRI data into R. The data should be in a 4D array (X, Y, Z, time).
# Compute the global mean signal for each time point.
# Subtract the global mean signal from the BOLD signal at each voxel.
# Here's a simple example using a hypothetical 4D fMRI data array called fmri_data:
#
# R
# Copy code
# # Assuming fmri_data is a 4D array (X, Y, Z, time)
# # Dimensions
# x_dim <- dim(fmri_data)[1]
# y_dim <- dim(fmri_data)[2]
# z_dim <- dim(fmri_data)[3]
# t_dim <- dim(fmri_data)[4]
#
# # Calculate the global mean signal for each time point
# global_mean_signal <- apply(fmri_data, 4, mean)
#
# # Subtract the global mean signal from the BOLD signal at each voxel
# gsr_data <- fmri_data
# for (t in 1:t_dim) {
#   gsr_data[, , , t] <- fmri_data[, , , t] - global_mean_signal[t]
# }
# This example assumes that you have already preprocessed your fMRI data (e.g., motion correction, spatial smoothing) and loaded it into R as a 4D array. The gsr_data array will now contain the BOLD signal with the global mean signal regressed out.
#
# Keep in mind that GSR is a controversial preprocessing step, and its use may depend on the specific goals of your study. Some researchers argue that it can introduce artifactual anti-correlations and distort the interpretation of functional connectivity results. Always consider the pros and cons of GSR before applying it to your data.
